# Stocky-Trades - finance flow app. A-Level NEA Trading Simulation App (2023–2024)
> **A real-time stock trading simulator** built as an A-Level Computer Science NEA, pushing the boundaries of what’s typical for school-level projects. Designed using JavaFX and live API data.

---

## 🚀 Overview

Stocky Trades is a feature-rich **JavaFX** desktop application simulating a real-time stock trading platform.
Real-time stock trading simulator with JavaFX, API integration, and PostgreSQL.
Unlike most NEA submissions (e.g., simple games or library systems), this project integrated **live data, financial charting, API calls, database interaction**, and a modular MVC design structure.

## 🧠 Lessons Learned

- Overcomplicating a project may limit your ability to finish critical components.
- Time management and scope creep are just as important as technical skills.
- Real-world tools like APIs and charts taught me more than any basic NEA.
- Simpler, fully working projects often score better than ambitious but incomplete ones.

## 💡 Reflection

Was this project too ambitious for an A-Level NEA?  
Or was it a great stretch goal that showed how much I was willing to challenge myself?

👉 Either way, I **learned more building this than in most of my coursework.**
